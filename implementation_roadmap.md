## Risk Management

The following risks have been identified for the implementation roadmap:

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Resource constraints | High | Medium | Prioritize features, consider outsourcing non-critical components |
| Technical complexity | Medium | Medium | Conduct technical spikes, allocate additional time for complex features |
| Integration challenges | High | Medium | Establish clear integration contracts, implement comprehensive testing |
| Performance issues | High | Low | Conduct performance testing early, implement monitoring |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Maintain strict change control, regular backlog grooming |
| User adoption | Medium | Low | Involve users in design, provide training and documentation |

## Success Metrics

The success of the implementation will be measured by the following metrics:

1. **Feature Completion**: Percentage of planned features successfully implemented
2. **Quality**: Number of defects identified in production
3. **Performance**: System response times and throughput
4. **User Satisfaction**: User feedback and adoption rates
5. **Business Value**: Measurable improvements in warehouse operations
